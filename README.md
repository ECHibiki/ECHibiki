### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The pinned repositories are various projects that Kissu uses on it's site.<br/>
Kissu.moe runs on a heavily modified variant of Vichan which interacts with various side services. I am currently progressing towards a replacement for vichan given PHP7.4's security EoL in November 2022. There are currently no plans for this replacement to be open source however projects such as https://github.com/ECHibiki/Community-Banners-2.0 , https://github.com/ECHibiki/Kissu-Feedback-and-Forms and the future search.php replacement service are open source and used as ways for me to gain expertise with golang before writting a serious imageboard engine.
