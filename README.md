### Kissu Software and Related Side Projects
Kissu.moe runs on a heavily modified variant of Vichan which interacts with various side services.<br/>
I am currently progressing towards a replacement for Vichan in Rustlang<br/>

### The Kissu-UI and Vichan-UI
Kissu-Fr(AKA the Kissu-UI or New-UI) is a modern ReactJS user interface aimed at modernizing the imageboard experience. Rather than a collection of pages, it is a React web application.  
<br/>
Because not everyone can run the Kissu-UI(as of writting iOS devices and obviously users not running javascript) Kissu has a dependance on the vichan pages rendered on Twig templates. Though, there is a plan to handle the html files in another templating language. Future work on Kissu will always have the web-app and the html pages.
