### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The pinned repositories are various projects that Kissu uses on it's site.
### Kissu Software and Related Side Projects
Kissu.moe runs on a heavily modified variant of Vichan which interacts with various side services.<br/>
I am currently progressing towards a replacement for Vichan given PHP7.4's security EoL in November 2022. <br/>
There are currently no plans for this replacement to be open source however projects such as ECHibiki/Community-Banners-2.0 , ECHibiki/Kissu-Feedback-and-Forms and the future search.php replacement service are open source and used as ways for me to gain expertise with golang.<br/>
hese projects are educational in nature and therefore I have little concern what you do with them, beyond following the liscences. This projects are ways for me to learn how to write a serious imageboard engine, perhaps you could do the same for your own purpose.
